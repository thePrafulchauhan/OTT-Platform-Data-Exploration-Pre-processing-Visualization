Recommendations:

There were only two types of content (Tvshow s or movies) which is available in the netflix which is the area that netflix can work on to improve the buisness. They can focus more on adding other types of content like streaming sports content like cricket, europian soccer, NBA or american football which can generate them a lot of viewership there by growing the buisness. They can also add content which was produced from the other parts of world like UAE, France, Bulgaria which was ignored before, so that they can cater its product to large number of audiences across the world to increase the viwership there by growing its business. They can also venture into adding other segment of unexplored video content types like adding short films, educational content etc. instead of restricting its type to only two (movies a nd TV shows). Netflix can also include content which was released relaively old from 1950 to 2000 as there are many movie lovers who loves to watch retro content.
